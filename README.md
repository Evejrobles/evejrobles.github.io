## Passion Project

About two growing seasons ago, we decided to build three raised bed planter boxes for our edible crops. Because we have large dogs,  we quickly saw the need to protect our herbs and vegies from trampling paws and urine streams. There was some thought put into what material the boxes were going to be constructed of(settled on cedar). Then measured, cut and attached the lumber. Calculated how much soil we had to buy to fill boxes. The best part of the project was planting. We wanted a good mix of vegies, herbs, and flowers(to attract polinators). We were super happy with our harvest and with the amount of joy we got watching butterflies, bees and birds visit our garden.

### Game Reflection

As a team we did very well. I noticed that we communicated well. We talked out strategies for success and implemented them. We won both times we played. We even tried to make it harder on ourselves by setting the water level higher to start. It was a super fun activity!
